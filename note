As I caanot upload 600 MB files in github this the link of all data set i have taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

I have uploaded 2 images(1. predicted by google and other by my model) where the random image taken from the google matches my prediction.

i have also attached the explanation video of my code.

to test on your own data you just have to run the whole code except the fit and predict on test data( these 2 takes approx 1.5 hrs each to run) and then change the file path in code and predict it.
